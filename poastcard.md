Poast
=========

*A calm and pleasant geo postcard environment*.
Inspired by postcards, penpals, postcard-ware.

### PoastCards

A poastcard is image, text, and geometry.  It can be represented in geojson, making use of geojson properties.

### Inspiration/Motivation

* Postcards, letters, penpals, postcardware

* Instabook is too busy intense

* Strava is good but narrow focus

* Urbit is based on communities of interest so friends are internet first - as opposed to facebook which takes realworld online, makes sense to share location as we make friends globally

* 

### Use Cases

* Lumphead wants to poast pictures of his handsome steers for his farming friends in remote life.

* Mrs. Lumphead wants to poast pictures of avocado on porridge-toast for a list of friends.

* Maximillian from Alice Springs, wants to poast a story about accidentally starting a spinifex fire, with geo details somewhat vague.

* Christopher from Alaska wants to poast precise details of a hike, but only for himself.

### Core Functionality

* Global/Grid view, shows recent poastcards and global view with pins

* Selected Poastcard view, shows single image, text, detailed geometry

  * Geometry is to be drawn with a drawing tool for now.  Loading from a device like a garmin, reading from photo metadata, or maybe even recording an event ala strava app could be future ideas.

* Create poastcard form, Title, text, image, geometry (point/pin, line, polygon), share with planets, groups?

* Mechanism for receiving/allowing poastcards from new ships, similar to direct messaging in landscape

### Longer term functionality

* Geometry obfuscation, use a slider to select privacy levels, reduced geometry to a bounding box, for eg

* Integration of garmin fit files etc.

* Comment threads under poastcards? or way of linking poastcards into different parts of urbit/landscape
